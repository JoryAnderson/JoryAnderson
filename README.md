### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you very much for visiting my portfolio. I've been working professionally as a software developer for the past few years now. I first started in a QA position and moved to a System Admin/DevOps/Developer role. I've been leaning more into the DevOps side of things -  recently I helped my department move from SVN onto GitLab, pipelines and all. Now we are moving to Cloud and I am hoping to start Guidewire and AWS certification soon. Please feel free to look through my projects!

Feel free to poke around my pinned repositories! 

- ðŸ”­ I just secured my first post-graduation employment opportunity! I'm hoping to keep my GitHub updated with additional projects and insights.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about quality assurance methodologies and automation frameworks. I find myself increasingly interested with DevOps philosophy and tooling.

- ðŸ“š The book I am currently reading is [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin). I also am reading through [The Phoenix Project]() by [Gene Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/realgenekim/), [George Spafford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gspafford/), and [Kevin Behr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinbehr/)!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! I am always willing to learn new skills and technologies.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about test automation technologies, new frameworks, parallelization, and test pipelining.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm now working hybrid! Work from home is great but it is nice to connect with your coworkers in person every so often.
